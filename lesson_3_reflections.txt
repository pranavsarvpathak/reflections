When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
We add a remote to our repository to share it with other people, so that they can contribute as well in the same efficient manner. To host it as well to get more exposure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To bring about desired changes and not result in any unexpected behaviour.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
1. CLONE is for github to github/local or local to local.(note when we clone, we automatically set a remote to the repository from where it was cloned, even if it is from other's account, but permission is required to push changes to that remote).
2. BRANCHES is a pointer used for tracking changes within the same repo .
3. FORK is to copy repo for github to github(used in cases when permission not acquired to make changes to someone's repo. Also to give credits to the original creator implicitly. else do clone, then push to our remote of the repository)


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
