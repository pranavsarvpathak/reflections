In a collaborative env it is required to make changes through pull request (in case of a merge conflict after generating pull request so that the desired barnch can be merged into master, 
1. pull into local,
2. update master into your desired branch
3. then push it so that the updated pull request can be reviewed by other members again
4. Only then should it be merged with master
).
Do the above, rather than merging in your local machine and direct pushing it.

Merging pull requests always generates a new commit, even in case of fast forward merges(i.e. when one branch is ancestor of another - also recommended to delete the branch if not master or not in further use).

We can merge pull request from browser
OR
we can fetch the branch and merge in our local
OR
we can pull the branch.

You just saw that the workflow when making changes in a separate branch is more complicated than working directly in master, especially when you need to stay up-to-date with changes others are making. Rather than simply pulling and pushing, you need to pull changes into your local master branch, merge the local master into your branch (different-oil, in our case), then push your branch to the remote before finally merging your branch into master, either locally or on GitHub.
